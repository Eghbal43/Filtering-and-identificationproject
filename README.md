# State Estimation for Autonomous Robots Using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
This project explores the application of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation in autonomous robots. The EKF is implemented to estimate a robot's 2D position, orientation, and velocity from noisy sensor measurements, demonstrating its ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and uncertainties. Key aspects include motion and measurement modeling, Kalman gain analysis, and innovation signal diagnostics. Simulations, conducted in MATLAB, reveal the EKF's effectiveness in reducing state estimation errors while highlighting challenges in positional accuracy due to the absence of direct position measurements. This project underscores the utility of the EKF in enhancing localization for autonomous systems and provides insights for future improvements in sensor integration and model refinement.
